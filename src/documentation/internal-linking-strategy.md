### Secondary Pages
- Assessment Flow (/assessment-intro → /assessment/:id → /report/:id)
- User Management (/profile, /settings, /help)

## Key Pages Requiring More Internal Links

### 1. **Dashboard** - Hub Page (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** Adequate linking
**Recommendations:**
- Add contextual links to assessment results
- Include "Quick Start" workflow links
- Feature recent activity with deep links
- Cross-link to incomplete assessments

**Anchor Text Variations:**
- "Start NIST CSF v2.0 assessment"
- "Continue implementation"
- "View compliance dashboard"
- "Check real-time status"

### 2. **Compliance Status Page** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** Needs more internal links
**Recommendations:**
- Link to specific evidence collection pages
- Connect to related policy documents
- Deep link to control implementation pages
- Add assessment comparison links

**Anchor Text Variations:**
- "Collect supporting evidence"
- "Review implementation policies" 
- "Address compliance gaps"
- "Schedule assessment activities"

### 3. **Assessment Pages** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** Isolated experience
**Recommendations:**
- Link to related help documentation
- Connect to evidence upload for questions
- Cross-reference policy requirements
- Link to similar assessment categories

**Anchor Text Variations:**
- "Upload evidence for this control"
- "View related policy requirements"
- "Access implementation guidance"
- "Compare with industry benchmarks"

### 4. **Asset Management** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** Good structure, needs cross-linking
**Recommendations:**
- Link to compliance impact analysis
- Connect to risk assessment pages
- Reference control implementation status
- Link to evidence requirements

**Anchor Text Variations:**
- "Assess asset compliance impact"
- "View asset risk analysis"
- "Check control implementation"
- "Review evidence requirements"

## Enhanced Breadcrumb Implementation

### Features Added:
- **Semantic navigation** with proper ARIA labels
- **Flexible separators** and home link options
- **Accessibility compliance** with screen reader support
- **Dynamic path resolution** based on current route
- **Custom home labels** for different contexts

### Usage Examples:
```jsx
// Standard breadcrumbs
<Breadcrumbs items={breadcrumbs} />

// Custom breadcrumbs with no home link
<Breadcrumbs 
  items={breadcrumbs} 
  showHome={false}
  separator={<span className="mx-2">→</span>}
/>
```

## Internal Linking Components

### 1. **InternalLinkCard**
- Styled cards for promoting related content
- Priority indicators and category badges
- Hover effects and proper accessibility
- Support for external links with security attributes

### 2. **QuickNavigationPanel**
- Context-aware navigation suggestions
- Category-based organization
- Priority-based sorting
- Excludes current page to avoid redundancy

### 3. **RelatedLinks**
- Intelligent link suggestions based on current page
- Category-based link types (next-step, prerequisite, resource)
- Priority-based ordering
- Customizable display options

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. **Link Attributes**
```jsx
// Internal links
<Link 
  to="/compliance" 
  aria-label="Navigate to compliance monitoring dashboard"
  className="hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors"
>
  Compliance Status
</Link>

// External links
<a 
  href="https://example.com" 
  target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  aria-label="Open resource in new tab"
>
  External Resource
</a>
```

### 2. **URL Structure Standards**
- **Logical hierarchy:** `/assets/inventory`, `/assets/categories`
- **RESTful patterns:** `/assessment/:id`, `/report/:id`
- **Descriptive paths:** `/compliance` instead of `/status`
- **Consistent naming:** Kebab-case throughout

### 3. **Anchor Text Guidelines**
- **Descriptive and specific:** "Start NIST CSF v2.0 assessment" vs "Click here"
- **Action-oriented:** "Collect evidence", "Review compliance status"
- **Context-aware:** "Upload evidence for this control"
- **Keyword-rich:** Include relevant NIST CSF terms

## Link Distribution Strategy

### High-Traffic Pages (3-5 internal links per section)
- Dashboard: 8-12 contextual links
- Compliance Status: 6-8 action-oriented links
- Assessment pages: 4-6 related resource links

### Medium-Traffic Pages (2-4 internal links per section)
- Asset management pages
- Team collaboration pages
- Policy and controls pages

### Low-Traffic Pages (1-3 internal links)
- Settings and profile pages
- Help documentation
- Individual asset/report detail pages

## Contextual Linking Rules

### 1. **Assessment → Implementation**
- Link from assessment questions to evidence collection
- Connect control gaps to policy requirements
- Cross-reference implementation guidance

### 2. **Implementation → Monitoring**
- Link from evidence collection to compliance tracking
- Connect policy updates to control monitoring
- Reference team collaboration for assignments

### 3. **Monitoring → Reporting**
- Link from compliance status to detailed reports
- Connect gaps to remediation recommendations
- Reference team performance analytics

## SEO and Performance Considerations

### 1. **Link Equity Distribution**
- Prioritize links to conversion pages (assessments, evidence collection)
- Balance link distribution across all major sections
- Use priority indicators for search engine guidance

### 2. **Page Load Optimization**
- Lazy load link previews and thumbnails
- Preload critical linked pages
- Use React Router for instant navigation

### 3. **Analytics Integration**
- Track link click-through rates
- Monitor user journey paths
- Identify content gaps through link analysis
